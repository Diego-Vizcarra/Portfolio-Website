                    <h3>Ready Player One Essay</h3>
                    <p>This is a brief excerpt from my essay about Ready Player One. In my CART English 11 class, we were tasked with producing an argumentative essay about why Ready Player One should be used more often in high schools. We were required to format the essay using MLA styling. The reason I selected the sample was that we were given only the time in class to finish it; in addition, it is one of my most recent works of writing making it much more relevant than older ones. </p>

                    <h3>Digital Responsibility Research Essay</h3>
                    <p>Earlier this year in our CART English 11 class, we did a research essay on a variety of topics focusing on digital ethics. The sample seen is just an excerpt from the entire essay. The essay was formatted in MLA with a page number in the top right and works cited at the end. The reason why I selected this sample is that it shows my level of writing near the beginning of the year and can be cross-referenced with my later works to check how I have improved.</p>
