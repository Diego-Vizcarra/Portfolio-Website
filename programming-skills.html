                        <h3>Photoshop</h3>
                        <p>My technology skill sample shows my ability to edit images using photoshop. As one of our first introductions to using Photoshop in our Web Application and Development class, we had to edit the background image by adding various styles and images. In the sample image, I added a hue/saturation to the background of a trail surrounded by trees. Secondly, I took an additional image and cropped out the woman from another image and placed her in this one. Then, I put a hurricane image in (since she was blowing snow so I thought of wind and hurricanes). Lastly, I added the text and arrow for that final touch. I learned how to utilize a few of the several features Photoshop has. I can use this to resize images for my websites so they load faster or increase the quality of the images so they bring visual interest to a page.</p>

                        <h3>HTML</h3>
                        <p>HTML is the basis of developing websites. Without it, none of my websites could even leave the planning stage. The sample picture is a screenshot of HTML from my career project website. It is very useful for layout and structure. I used a header tag to group every element that would be at the top of the page and would be a link. Then I used h1-3 to be the titles of the paragraphs or lists that followed them. The structure and layout that HTML brings to a webpage is very useful and helps create context for the content.</p>

                        <h3>CSS</h3>
                        <p>CSS gives a website that "pop" that keeps people interested in it. It isn't as interactive as Javascript; however, it still gives limited interactivity along with better responsiveness to different sizes to enable the user to have a comfy experience on any size screen. The example screenshot is from this website's CSS. Each page has its own id that I use to manipulate the colors and layout as to keep users visually interested. The header is the same across the entirety of the website so that is the only part that isn't inside of an id. The usefulness it has though is creating that difference between simple HTML and a professional multi-column, flexing page on a company's website.</p>
