                    <h2>First Letter of Recommendation</h2>
                    <p class="right">November 7, 2017</p>
                    <p>To whom it concerns;</p>
                    <p>
                        I have known Diego Vizcarra for the last three years. I first got to meet Diego in robotics. He was volunteering at a competition where I was a judge. Diego was a very organized young man who did not need to be told twice how to do something. I was surprised to find out that he was a freshman. After talking with him, I hoped he would take honors chemistry the next year so I would get a chance to help him pursue his love of engineering and problem solving.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I had the pleasure of having Diego in my Honors Energy Academy Chemistry class at Buchanan High School last year. The Diego I had gotten to know at this competition was the student I saw in class. During group activities, Diego would come alive. He enjoyed the challenge of not knowing the process. In group activities, they were given a question or a topic that they had to create a lab around to answer with data as evidence. Most students get frustrated when they see these labs because it does not tell them what to do. Not Diego. Diego got his group talking about what they needed to measure and gathered data around the question. Diego was very good about not over powering a group, but being that reserved leader that supports the idea, listens, and supports his group to come to an idea. Diego continues to support his groups in activities like Robotics.

                        At lunch time and before school, I get to see Diego with frequent visits. He continues to grow with robotics. Diego is now in a leadership role on the robotics team. I enjoy our talks about the world and what he can do to support his group. Being a leader has its challenges. I appreciate that Diego asks others for advice before he plans on a large move. Diego gains all of the respect from his teammates because he gives it as much as he gains it. It is great to see Diego’s confidence raised and his reality that he can do anything. Diego takes on a leadership role in class, his activities, and in life. I can’t wait to see what amazing things he does with his talents.

                   <h2>Second Letter of Recommendation</h2>
                    <p class="right">
                        April 8, 2018
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To Whom It May Concern:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am writing this letter of recommendation for Diego Vizcarra. Diego is a student at Buchanan High School and I have had the privilege of knowing him for the past year. Diego is bright young man with an incredible future ahead of him. Diego has been a part of our band program during his freshman and sophomore years of high school, participating in our Marching Band. While participating in band his sophomore year, Diego also began working with our school’s robotics team. He has shown how motivated of a person he is during her time in these program’s. While participating in these programs, Diego has maintained above a 3.6 grade point average every year in his high school career, earning him two Principal’s Honor Roll awards and two High Honor Roll awards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Diego is also a member of our Buchanan High School Energy and Engineering Academy. During his time in this program, Diego has taken several courses related to the environmental engineering fields. Due to his participation in this program, Diego will graduate with academy honors and receive a green cord for his accomplishment of successfully fulfilling all of the course requirements needed for participating in the Energy and Engineering Academy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Diego’s welcoming and energetic personality, motivation, and determination to gain knowledge makes Diego an ideal candidate. I give Mr. Vizcarra my highest recommendation for any opportunity coming his way. Diego would be an asset to any group or organization and I have no doubts that he will exceed the expectations given to him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
