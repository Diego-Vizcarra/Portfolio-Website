                    <h3>Endangered Species Website</h3>
                    <p>One of the first websites I ever created was for this project. We were required to put all of the research we had done on the endangered species my group had chosen, which was the Galapagos Penguin, into a website format. We started by producing photoshop mockups of what the end website would somewhat resemble (better looking of course). Then I brought our mockups to life by using Brackets to code the website. I had to constantly keep checking how it looked in the browser so I could fix its appearance if needed right away. I can use the debugging and troubleshooting skills for other applications and websites that I make as I continue on my path as a programmer. <a href="http://diegov.x10host.com/public/penguin">Click Here to Visit the Site</a>

                    <h3>Digital Ethics</h3>
                    <p>In this project, our class had to work together to produce a website educating people about digital ethics and why they are so important. My group was given the topic of teen driving and the use of technology. My role was to explain the consequences of using technology while driving. I kept on having to write and rewrite code to try and conform to the rest of the website. For instance, I had to completely change the background to look like the rest of the website. I wrote the code for this in Brackets and resized the images using Photoshop. I can use this as a base to help me build up communication skills with other people within a group. <a href="http://cartwebapp.com/student17/showcase/pm/TD-consequences.html">Click Here to Visit the Site</a></p>

                    <h3>Career Project</h3>
                    <p>The first medium sized website project we had in our class. Each student was tasked with finding a career that they would like to become. We all found the information on our careers from the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/">BLS</a> website. We then used Microsoft Word to organize all of our research to later format on the website. I pulled up the images based on key words so I could place them to help give areas better appeal or context. This project helped kick start my skills to enable me to better develope websites.<a href="http://diegov.x10host.com/public/career-project/">Click Here to Visit the Site</a></p>
