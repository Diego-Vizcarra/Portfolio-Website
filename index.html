                        Hello and welcome to my portfolio website. Here you will find various information about my achievements and progress as a programmer, including examples of my work and ways to contact me. I will be updating this website as regularly as possible to include up to date information on me. Hopefully the site itself can serve as a milestone keeper and keep track of my progress as a web developer. Visit the other pages to learn more about myself.
