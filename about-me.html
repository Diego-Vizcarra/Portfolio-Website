                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        My name is Diego Vizcarra and I currently live in Clovis, California. I am currently a student at Buchanan High School; also, I am taking a programming course at Center for Advanced Research and Technology. Some web projects that I have completed focus on teaching key points for programming while others focus on conveying an argument for or against a topic. One website I have worked on with others is about Digital Ethics with my page focusing on the use of technology while driving. Another web project I have done would be a website stating why we need to save the Galapagos Penguins. I have been involved in some community outreach in robotics such as promoting our team at the Clovis farmers market.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I strive to be an outstanding student who can adapt to different situations. As of right now, I am unemployed; however, I am searching for a job to work at during the summer. My goals for the future are getting into UC Berkeley as one of my top colleges. The major I am pursuing is either computer programming or physics. My favorite hobby is playing video games since they are lots of fun to play by oneself and with others. Some of the games that I own are Subnautica, Team Fortress 2, Minecraft, and various others. I play these games via steam, except for Minecraft. The genres I prefer to play are role play games, survival, and certain first-person shooters. I love to gain new experiences with friends.
