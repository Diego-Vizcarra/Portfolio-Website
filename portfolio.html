            <h2>Portfolio Summary</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Over this last year I have learned many things about programming and developing websites. Not only that but I have learned many skills to aid in the design of them. This portfolio is just one way to explain what I have done and show how I have grown. Just like marking on a wall your growth, each page has its own "mark" showing how far I have come. Not many marks are here right now, but many more will come as I grow as both a student and a programmer.

                <p>
                    This page focuses on my projects that I have been assigned since starting CART. This lists only three out of the five or so websites I have produced, and shows some great improvement from the first to the last. <a href="web-projects.html">Learn More...</a>

                <h3>Examples of Literature</h3>
                <p>
                    English has never been my strongest subject in school. It always takes me a while to come up with the topic, let alone giving context and placing it on the page. However, when I finish and essay, it usually end up being quite a nice read. <a href="sample-writing.html">Learn More...</a>

                <h3>Examples of Technical Skills</h3>
                <p>
                    The more recent websites I have made have used technical skills I have built upon over this last year. These skills help me prepare for building my websites and visualizing them before changes are permanent. As I develop more and more websites, I am sure my skills will improve. <a href="programming-skills.html">Learn More...</a>
